### Why Use Inheritance?
* The main advantage of inheritance is minimizing the amount of duplicate code
* To change behavior, you can override and modify the appropriate methods while keeping all of the other behaviors

### Inheritance is different from pure abstraction because both classes are concrete classes. Nothing is abstract.

### Disadvantage of Inheritance
* Superclass and subclass can become tightly coupled
* More levels of implementation to jump through in order to find the appropriate functionality
