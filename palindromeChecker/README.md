## A palindrome checker. 

#### A palindrome is a word or phrase which reads the same backwards as it does forwards. For example, Civic and racecar are both palindromes. Words like swims, mad, and wifi are not palindromes because they do not read the same backwards and forwards. 

#### This palindrome checker function will take in one input, a string, and it will output true or false depending on whether the string is a palindrome or not. Any other punctuation or symbols must also follow the palindrome rules. 

#### The main exception is for lowercase and uppercase letters. These shall be considered the same. For example, civic with an uppercase C should count as a palindrome.
